Hi, how are u?
I'm **Leonel Marcos**, 21 yo. Recently I engaged on a journey to become a successful developer, because I always loved tech,
but, for some reason, always held myself back. I'm also a very passionate artist.

Today, I use mainly **python**, but my toolset also includes **HTML**, **CSS**, a bit of **C#** and **javascript**, having using this one, especially, along with **Unity**.
As for audio visual, I have a pretty good experience with **Adobe Photoshop**, **Premiere**, **Illustrator**, **Krita** and **Blender**.
